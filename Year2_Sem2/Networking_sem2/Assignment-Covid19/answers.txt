2)Difference between TCP and UDP:
	TCP = (Transmission Control Protocol):
		SOCKET = you will need ONE TCP Socket for EACH client in application.
		
		GENERAL:
		- CONNECTION-ORIENTED protocol that computers use to communicate via the Internet. 
		- One of main protocols in TCP/IP networks. 
		- It PROVIDES error-checking and GUARANTEES delivery of data.
		- Reliable, checks for erros and tracks packets so data not lost.
		- Flow-control, to ensure sender not 'overwhelmed' by too many packets.
		- Orders data, ensures recieved data in same order as when sent.
		- Slower, alot more to do.
		- Best suited for applications requiring HIGH RELIABILITY:
			World Wide Web(HTTP,HTTPS)
			Secure Shell(SSH)
			File Transfer Protocol(FTP)
			Email.
		

	UDP = (User Datagram Protocol):
		SOCKET = you can SEND and RECIEVE to/from anyone at any time with SAME SOCKET.

		GENERAL:
		- CONNECTIONLESS protocol, similiar to TCP, but assumes that error-checking and recovery 				services are NOT REQUIRED. 
		- Instead, UPD continuously sends datagrams to the reciever whether they reciever them or 				not.
		- Unreliable, packet may become corrupt or lost in transit.
		- NO Flow-control, packets arrive in continuous stream or they are dropped.
		- NO Ordering, sends data in any order.
		- Faster.
		- Best suited for applications requiring SPEED and EFFICIENCY:
			VPN tunneling
			Streaming VIDEOS
			Online Games
			Live Broadcasts
			Domain Name Systems(DNS)
			Voice over Internet Protocol(VoIP)
			Trivial File Transfer Protocol(TFTP).
